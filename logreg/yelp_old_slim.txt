Absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a Saturday night.  To top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being MIA, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food.  On the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly (even before the chips and salsa appetizer?).

Great double date place that allowed us to bring our dogs to sit at the table outside with us. Although it took a long time to get a table, the beer made up for it. As well as the BBQ chicken. The Sunday special will have me coming back for only the chicken and cornbread. \nDownside was the service, and when we were advertised the BBQ buffet, we ordered seconds and got \""the last of it,so enjoy\"". And no chicken. \nGood atmosphere.

Wish there was another one close by. Their delivery employees are reckless drivers. It's hit or miss on the customer service you will receive when placing your order over the phone.

Locals discount.\nAte shrimp, clams, mussels, crab legs, crawfish, prime rib & all sorts of fixings. Some items were not as warm as preferred. Good desserts. Didn't really care for being seated way on far edge in area with out of control kids just because we had a toddler too. She's not typical and quite well mannered.\nUpdated 11/10/14 up all night sick from something I ate. Not pleasant.

I hate to give this bar and grill such a low rating, but the past few times I have been there, the service has been awful. My (now ex) girlfriend and I stood for 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to come and seat us. This would not have been such a problem had it not been 10 PM and there were only 2 tables with people at them. As far as food goes, it's not bad. Basic bar food, minus the pepper jack burger which is amazing. I will probably not be coming back to this location.

The guy is rude and when I did not want to upgrade he got even ruder. \nHopefully by adding this review they will learn cheap service on an offer such as this will never gain them repeat business.

Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi.

Great atmosphere, easy to book and get reservations, extensive wine list.. Mind boggling to say the least if you arent overly knowledgeable with wines like myself.  Antipasta appetizer was excellent.. Perfect blend of italian cheeses and meets.  I had the pasta sampler which included lobster gnocchi.. Obviously homemade gnocchi and cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent, very attentive waiter but not overly attentive which is good.  Price is as expected for a restaurant of this quality at the mgm grand hotel

This Panda is close to home, but has the poorest quality of the half a dozen or so Panda's I've been to. I really wanted some Panda so I gave it another try at this location and received an all time low with no shrimp in the surf & turf and really hot orange chicken on over cooked noodles (rubber).

Had family visit. Took my dad here on a Fri night to have a couple drinks. Found an unwelcoming door person. Place charged $7 to enter. 1) What bars charge cover anymore 2) If you are gonna charge why not the typical $5 or $10. Does it really have to be an odd ball number like 7. Nothing special was going on in there.

Yeesh, my second visit to this place bared little resemblance to the first. Most polarizing was the service. Our server was nice enough, but she was completely clueless (forgetting multiple things) and ever so slow (with a section that was not full). Additionally, the quality of the pizza was not up to the same high standards of the first visit. I will probably give this joint another chance, but will be much more reluctant now.

Had them move me a few days ago for the second time in two years. Both times were amazing. I went with them due to affordable price and family recommended.  They were spot on both times with flawless service. I didn't get the owner either time but his 3 man crew both times were friendly and quick and didn't harm our brand new home. clearly the only person who didn't give 5 stars so far is the competition or had a miscommunication on their end...because I got multiple followup calls and confirmations.

I don't know if it is because my family and I went early or what but service shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a roll. Not only were we not greeted right away it took forever to get our sushi. The sushi rolls were okay but not worth the wait or the money especially since they were slow. Plus it sounded more like we were in a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. I am all for speaking a different language but not so loud you make your customers uncomfortable. All in all we will not be coming back.
I don't remember if it is because my boyfriend and myself arrived early or what but service shouldn't take about minutes to be a roll. Some only were we not waiting as though it left in to take our check. Great sushi food were great but not why the amount or the portion especially since they were slow. Not it worth more but we were in a nice restaurant than a Japanese table. Would am all for giving a Chinese sushi but not so loud you make your din nervous. Service in all we will not be coming anywhere.

This place was AMAZING. Up until I went to Stripsteak my favorite steak place was Cut by Wolfgang puck. But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!

Steve, our waiter, was amazing and handled our group of 7 adults with swift precision and courtesy. Everyone in our party was impressed with their appetizers & entre's. It was a great experience. Members of our party also kept commenting favorably about the \""Old Las Vegas\"" selection of music classics by Martin, Sinatra, etc. A lot of food so plan on a to-go box.

Don't eat here!!! Waited in line with 10 other people for 30 minutes even though there were a dozen open tables. We concluded they were trying to get a line going to draw attention to the place. The food was not good, basically Hometwon Buffet style. To too it off I got food poisoning, probably from the sushi. The only redeeming quality is if you drink they have free alcohol.

Okay. I think it's safe to say that the Cine Capri at Tempe Marketplace is the best screen to watch any movie. There's usually a couple dollar increase in the ticket price, but it's worth is if you want to enjoy the movie you are there to watch. This theater gets the most attention from staff as well so it's always clean. It's also the best place to watch a movie on opening night. Go see TRON at this theater December 16th.

I LOVE that Jet Blue is flying from Burbank to Vegas again!  It makes me so happy that there is an alternative from Southworst.  You get to pick your own seats, No cattle calls, and TV!! OMG a lifesaver.  Everyone should fly Jet Blue and support them!  More trips to come!

There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live \""bad\"" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about.

Okay guys 20 mins for a spice ice tea and coffee when we tell you that we are in a hurry.  Tell us you cant do it.  Much better than leaving us hanging until we walk out.  So quick tip yelpers you must have time to visit Red Velvet, between a regular following and a mellow staff time can tick by.

Great happy hour. I met a friend last minute for happy hour a few weeks ago and based on a past experience over a year ago, we decided to go back. The wine selection and happy hour appetizers were really good and well priced. Our service was excellent too. The waitress had a great personality and even made me laugh. Tough to come by these days so i appreciated that. Wish i got her name. I'd go back again.

I don't remember who did my wax, but she was terrible. And I have had many many waxes. Not only was I burned (and had a scab for 5 days afterwards), but I had to give her a tip on how to wax the top part of the bikini and ask her to stop after she couldn't figure out how to properly set-up most strips. It was incredibly painful and took way too long.  She also seemed super nervous. Needless to say I won't be back for that service and I am very disappointed.

Ordered the south point cut and received what appeared to be a slice of garbage meat floating in blood. It tasted like week old supermarket leftovers and the texture was slimy and soft. After cutting away the fat which was 2/3 of the \""steak\"" I was left with a small portion of what barely passed for meat. Essentially you are paying $10 extra over the $6.99 prime rib special you'd get at 3 am for some mood lighting. I definitely do not recommend this place if you're not looking for a decent steak.
Ordered the south hamb brisk and received what said to be a slice of regular meat bun in a. That tasted like fresh meat with leftovers and the bun was slimy and mush. After cutting away the bacon which was half/full of the \""steak\"" I was happy with a small piece of what had deserved for fries. But you are paying $10 extra over the $6.One prime rib and you'd order at 3 am for some 4 lighting. Will definitely do not consider this visit if you're not a for a good value.

What an awesome neighborhood joint. As an out of towner I was lucky to get taken here! No frills food, drinks and company. Great jukebox with a wide selection and lovely waitresses that don't ask if you want another drink...they ask if you want another pitcher. \n\nIt's set on the main strip in the neighborhood and has a great feel. Even my first time here I felt super comfortable, nice dive bar feel without being super...divey.\n\nMake sure and tag the chalkboard in the womens bathroom, much more civilized than a sharpie!

Roger was Aaaaaamazing! He was great, sweet, and definitely a confidence booster. He transformed my hair into a beauty. The staff was courteous and patient. The decor was very stylish. My main attraction to the place is how Roger honestly cared about what I wanted with my hair, and when I wasn't too sure, he gave me lots of suggestions. I will surely be coming back.

Spoon is probably one of the best restaurants in the Pittsburgh Area. I won't even review it because as excellent as my experience was, I'm not sure if I'm the caliber of foodie that can really write a meaningful review. I can't come up with the adjectives to fully elaborate on the Apps that we had which were the Garden vegetable baby mix green salad and bacon and eggs and my entree of Cassoulet. While this place was spendy, I thought that it was worth it!

Moon is a pretty fun club to go to if you are trying to decide on where to go to dance on your trip to Vegas. Located inside the Palms, it is high on the top the hotel. It has a dance floor in the middle of the club and a roof that is retractable, opening up to the sky above. It also has an outdoor patio area that overlooks all of Las Vegas. The music is good and the people all seem to be there to have fun.

I have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors. However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of \""respect\"" to what a customer orders.  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken.  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish.  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen City.

We love Zada's! Jodie makes the best Mimosa and Bloody Mary and always has a smile on her face.  Great variety and selection of healthy, fresh, and local food whether you are a vegetarian or not. The bacon is amazing as is the French toast and their Huevos. Sometimes we just grab a biscuit to go which is also a great option. \nDon't miss out on this spot! It does get crowded at high times but Jodie will make you a mimosa or there is free coffee while you wait!

Yum!

The pizzas are large enough to satiate a full appetite, or even to be split if you only have the munchies.\n\nThe mushrooms on their pizzas are the perfect kind; small and flavorful and a perfect compliment to the pepperoni. With some chili oil you've got proper flavor in abundance!

Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon.

When I saw this place while walking between Palazzo and Venetian, it looked good. So I decided to try it on the day we leave on Sat 5/25. I bought two denishes and a slice of carrot cake. They were aweful. Basically they were not made the day. I don't know how long they have been on display, but the denises are hard and the carrot cake has a taste of fat which has been few days after they were made. I don't this this place belongs to Palazzo.

I took my cat here for boarding and they were so good to him.  He is a very mean tempered difficult cat when away from home and they were still very kind to him and did what they could to make him feel comfortable.  They were very nice when I picked him up, helping me get him back in his carrier and making me feel better about him being so difficult.  Very accommodating and kind staff.  Facility is very clean.  I would definitely return.

State Street Brats sucks. Normally, I hate to be so blunt in a review but that essentially sums up my SSB \""experience\"". Very dimly lit sports bar with over priced, overcooked food. Important to note, they cook the burgers well done, unless you specify otherwise. Brats taste little different than you'd get from a gas station. Always heard good things about this place. Not impressed.

Overpriced and skimpy on quantity.  This was, by far, the worst cheesesteak I've ever had.  The sandwich, fries, and drink was almost $15!  ...and this is a restaurant in a mall food court, no excuse it should be that much.  The portion if meat you get is sad, just sad.  I'll stick with trusty cappriotis.

Love the food always have but the attitude this girl has Diana needs to change, I asked if they still had bowls and you know what she said to me! She said \""yea no shit we do\"" and rolled her eye's at me. Even the mext guest she took care of said she should smile more and she gave him attitude also. So if you come and she is here short young girl, will probably be on her phone, be prepared for some attitude.  MANAGEMENT PLEASE RETRAIN HER OR FIRE HER, she is definitely ruining the l&l brand.

Recently went back and saw a really nice looking leather and fur coat, but upon purchasing I asked the cashier what kind of fur it was he told me it was faux-pony fur. For $400? Absolutely not. Whoever runs this place needs to wake up and ditch the faux leather and fur. It's awful! How does it make sense to wear plastic instead of natural leather or fur? It just doesn't. I've spent already $1200 on leather coats with them but this time I was really disappointed, I won't go back.

I went back for the 2nd time today and they've re-did the inside there is much more room. I had a bagel sandwich and an ice mocha coffee that is easily comparable to Dutch Brothers but half the price. If you haven't been to Bagel Nosh in a while I recommend trying them again!

Thin crispy fries (I like fries crispy)\n\nHere's the rub, the food listed above is pushing 2000 calories, I'm 30 now and I live in Scottsdale, where I feel like everyone is fit or at least fairly thin. So my vanity keeps me out of there.\n\nThat aside, don't let the funny name keep you from stopping in, it's some good stuff.

A great spot with local beers on tap, live DJs on the weekends, and an interesting array of indie and foreign films. The interior is slightly swanky without being pretentious, and it's usually quiet enough to have a decent conversation. The theater was a bit bigger than I expected based on the size of the bar. Overall, this is a good place to come with your friends, on a date, or even on your own for a beer or three.

This is a paradise for eaters of dead animals, but not so much for vegetarians, despite the claim of \""farm to table.\""  I certainly consider myself an omnivore, yet found the menu took heavy on fried, cheesy, bready stuff.  Table service was S L O W, and the men's room smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in several days.  When the store is located in Las Vegas, it gets hot, and you need good ventilation/AC.  That wasn't the case here.

I've been to this store over and over again because a friend keeps dragging me along, but have never found anything that tempted me in the least.  Much of the stuff is obviously worn out, damaged, or passed over for a good reason.  This isn't a necessary feature of a \""last call\"" type of store--I just think this particular store is useless.

Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks. The sandwich had great flavor but needed more of the elements, not enough caramelized onions or apples. Husband liked Cowboy burger but seasoned fries were way over the top on seasoning. Good service, great atmosphere, bleh quality. If the quality was stepped up to excellence they'd have something great going!

Worst place ever to watch a game. Audio up audio down audio up audio down the entire game. Who ever complains the loudest gets their way with game sound. Until the next person complains. Food average.

Was not impressed at all..overpriced for the quality of the sushi, service was not very friendly.  The presentation of the food was surprisingly poor.  We will stick with Yume Sushi in Scottsdale.  Hands down the best on all levels!

Great curry and great service! Their curry was delicious; served with a variety of toppings (I had veggies and chicken katsu. YUM!) and offered as mild, medium, or hot! The cashier/waitress was really helpful and polite. The restaurant was very clean and our kids ate free because we dined in.

I had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. They were still very comfortable, so I thought I'd have them cleaned and conditioned. The company that came over to clean them said they were beyond repair. Leather Like New was recommended and both pieces now look good as new...I kid you not. It's unbelievable what they did to each piece. Thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job.

I prefer the off-strip younger resorts.  I typically choose to stay at Hard Rock, Rio, or Palms.  They are a bit more hip, not crowded with hover-rounds, and offer kick-ass pools.  The room was updated and nice.  The dealers were friendly, and the on-site food was ok.

Awful. Not friendly. Sold us wrong products. Employees clueless. Not a typical Camping World. If you have the opportunity to visit Mesa or another store, do it and save yourself a lot of headaches and money in returning the wrong merchandise - they recommended.

I went into this nail salon for the first time with my 3 year-old daughter as she loves to get her nails done and looks forward to it every week. The owner did her nails. While she was painting them, she touched my daughter's forehead and said \""She needs to wax her eyebrows.\"" This was said to my daughter so she could hear. How anyone says this to a child is beyond me. I will NEVER go back and will tell everyone about this. I'm disgusted with this salon and the owner.

Just back from a wonderful stay in Montreal at the incomparable Chez Swann. Gorgeous hotel with a sexy boutique vibe. Comfortable bedding and an incredible shower made for the perfect crash space at the end of a day of exploring and wandering. The concierge, Herman, was an absolute gem who was always helpful and pleasant and genuine and who directed us to the best that this wonderful city has to offer. I have stayed in a number of hotels world wide but few measure up to the experience of Chez Swann. 5 stars!

They totally ruin the browsing experience of a library by not organizing the non fiction section into general subjects i.e. Cookery.  It's alphabetically done so you have to go the 'V' shelf to go to the vegan cookbooks.  Free WiFi didn't go through on my pc.  Plenty of parking though.  Even though it is a bigger building, it has less books than the Sahara library.

The concept for this show is great, and it could be hilarious.  But, one of the actresses, Lisa Mack (playing the professional woman) is such a terrible actress, it's impossible to get past her hamming it up and just enjoy the show.  \n\nThe song adaptations are funny, but the singing in this play is NOT at a professional level.\n\nThis show needs to be re-cast with professional level actresses who can actually sing!\n\nAll in all, I kept thinking, \""This is like a bad high school production!\""  This show definitely is NOT worth $60!

Went for dinner - Service was excellent.\n\nStarters were overpriced (escargot - tasty but not worth the cost), sea bass was overcooked and possibly gone bad, - sent back after one bite and didn't bother replacing with a different dish.  Rib eye steak frites had a decent steak but disappointing, thin, unevenly cooked frites.  \n\nLoud, dark atmosphere before 8:30pm seemed a bit mis-matched with the vibe the menu was trying to set.  I would still try again for breakfast based on other reviews but wouldn't go back for dinner, even at a discount...

Mike n Molly's is a great time for those looking to enjoy the variety that Champaign-Urbana has to offer. The gigs are almost always entertaining and the staff is very responsive and friendly. It's a nice place to go with a small group of friends and have a few, or even dance on Saturdays. As a college student, I think it's fantastic for my new friends that Mike n Molly's lets them in at 19+, because it's a real bitch finding other bars that do that.

They did a great job on my hair, and I have very long and thick blonde hair.  There was a slight smudge on my highlights where the bleach leaked out of the foils, but it wasn't due to lack of skill or attention.  Other than that my experience was great and I was very happy to have used my Groupon.  It's about as expensive as other Aveda salons, but you definitely get quality products and service for the money.

So the boba here is good, depending on who makes it. The food is hit or miss depending on what time of day you get it. I usually get Pad Thai here and sometimes it's fantastic, sometimes you wonder what the hell they put in it. Needless to say, I got food poisoning this last time around so I think I'll just stick to the boba. Other than that, the staff is pretty cool. It'll do in a pinch.

If you like brown, this is the place to hike.\n\nDid the Gateway Loop.  Counter clockwise.  The first mile felt like it took forever.  And I questioned only having one bottle of water for me and the wife.  I was starting to think about sucking cactus juice.  But once we got to the Gateway Saddle it was smooth sailing, cooler, greener, and less arid.\n\nA good 3.6 mile hike that will take about 3 hours if you walk it at a decent clip.

Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.

If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\n\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.

poor service, took 10 minutes to get water. Never got refilled. Food was slightly more interesting than IHOP or Denny's but about the same quality. Great place to go after a night of drinking I suppose. We won't be back, just wasn't impressed.

This perennialy 1-2 Star neighborhood McDonald's recently underwent a complete remodeling, so I stopped in for lunch today to see if they're doing better.  It's nice inside with lots of booths (Yay booths!), and has a completely different floor plan than before.\n\nI went with a Quarter Pounder Haba\u00f1ero Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, medium Fries & a small Chocolate Shake ($7.78).  Everything was right with both the food & the restaurant this time & it was excellent for the money.     :-))\n\nNow about those 610+380+570=1460 calories!     :-O

Best customer service.  What sets this place apart is the attention you get from the people who truly care about you getting the right pair of shoes.  This may cause you to wait a little bit longer if you go at a very busy time.  Often, I've come here thinking I want something specific for my daughters and they are so patient about getting them fitted, and helping them choose the right pair of shoes that they will not outgrow in 2 seconds.

A real dump as far as Del Taco locations go. The Bus Stop out front provides a steady stream of degenerates coming in and out. Fairly clean inside and the food was average for a Del Taco, but the service was SLOW. I wish I could type slower to emphasize just how S-L-O-W it really is here. =O)

I even bought the photo--this is the first time I have done that for any ride.  The obvious downfalls are price and the length of the ride is too short.

I've gone to the Mane twice and have been happy with both haircuts. I've had two different people cut my hair and it seems like everyone there has lots of experience. The only thing I wasn't totally satisfied with was the straight razor shave. It wasn't terrible but I've had better.

I ordered their 1/2 pound burger, burger was cooked perfect but it came with this huge bun that was a little dry, I actually enjoyed the fries more than the burger. Service was slow at first but they got better. Overall...probably not coming back.

I was finally able to satisfy my drought for decent Mexican food when some friends took me here for dinner! Let me tell you there are Rey few Mexican food options in Honolulu and I was quite happy with this place. A bit chaotic up front, no one seems to know how to place an order. Way too many options and permutations on items to order! However, when the food finally comes (and it comes quick), its really awesome! I tried the combination dish with carne asana along with the pork fried rice. Awesome!

I could not find fault with any of them.\nEven the desserts were amazing. My only issue was our waitress disappeared around time for dessert so we had to ask another server to send her over.\nIf there would not have been such a delay..and we did wait a bit..I would have given them 5 stars.\nI will be back again soon though.

Surprised that I liked staying at this place not thinking what it was about.  Easy access to the strip and street for taxis.  Good places to eat.  Didn't do the shopping but it's a nice feature, good location.  Got a room for pets so it was oversized plus it was free for 3 nights.  Nice roomy bathroom, beds could be more comfortable and I'd recommend coffee machines in the room.

Easy in, easy out! I also love Whole Foods, but I find that I always buy a bunch of things that look good that I don't need when I go there.  They have most of the same products in their health aisle.  I've been very pleased with the organic produce I have purchased from here.  Keep in mind that it is like a Trader Joes, in the sense that they do carry some non-organic items.  So, for a quick trip, Sprouts does the trick.

The flavor of the sauce on the wings was quite bazaar in my opinion and the tarragon on the fries was extremely overpowering. But to top it all off the service was really below average. I was very disappointed in my dining experience here and for the price point there are much better burgers out there.

Nothing really great about this place. They've got nice posters on the wall, but that's about it. Their fries are mediocre at best, and the dogs are pricey. Oh and instead of having a baseball game on like they should, they decided for some odd reason to have fox news on. Bad choice.\nGo to weinersnitzel's on eastern/serene instead. You're not missing anything, and it's cheaper.

Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Had the kimchi beef fried rice and barely ate any of it.  The kimchi flavor was so overpowering, I could hardly taste anything else (and it's not like I'm not used to the flavor - I'm half Asian and was raised on Asian food).  There was hardly any beef in it (trust me, I dug through the pile of rice looking for it).  That said, the portions are huge and the service was nice.  I just wish I had ordered something else.

Make sure to ask about the level your sandwich will be toasted. My sandwich was cold. I did not go back to the location because it was far from my departing gate. The whole purpose of Quiznos is for toasted subs/sandwiches. Now I regret walking all the way over there from concourse E. I've had toasted sandwiches from Quiznos before and for the price this location charges, one would think they would be more diligent about toasting the toasted sandwich as it is advertised. Not a good experience.

No one there was friendly. The guy that helped when I drove up up sold me to the 50$ package... an hour later and a $10 tip later there is still grime patches all over my rims, the rear view side mirrors still have water spots on the upper half and the interior is all streaky... won't be back

This is a hidden gem of a restaurant! It's tucked behind the Walgreens at Dobson & Chandler, and boasts a very large, casual dining room with enough space for big parties/families.\n\nThe menu is an interesting assortment of Mexican & Asian spiced meats, about 5 rice options, either refried beans or Cuban black beans, and each of our meals came with a big snickerdoodle or chocolate cookie.\n\nThere were 6 of us, we sampled one another's meals, loved everything! Examples: Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Hengrenade Chicken, Chinese BBQ Pork, Machaca.\n\nChino Bandido's is a MUST-TRY place. Can't wait to return!

This place has become a top favorite in a very short period! They have amazing fresh food that tastes home cooked! Abs every time I have been here the staff has Ben super friendly and attentive. Weekends there is just about always a wait when I come for breakfast but it's so worth it. I would def recommend this place. Support a small business and get amazing food with huge portions and friend budgets doesn't get better then that! And for my bacon lovers out there you must try the bacon on it's own!! Super thick and crispy goodness!!

Best NY style pizza you can get in the area.  Whether it's late night, or delivery, you're going to get delicious pizza, crispy but not floppy crust, and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well, is flavorful and doesn't drip.  People write a lot about how it's too greasy, etc etc, if that turns you off, then just go to Crust or something!  I think people who enjoy Joe's know what they're getting and are big fans of it.  \n\nGet some!!

So had lunch here with a colleague when we were passing each other going to two different conventions in Vegas. Food was good. Service was interesting. The servers were wonderful but the waitress was a little inattentive? Could of been just that it was slow and 2:30 so maybe they had cut staff. Enjoyed the lunch though and he picked up the bill! EDIT: The bread basket was great

I like to start by saying i grew up and lived in Philadelphia my entire life until moving here about 7 years ago. Anyone from there would agree it's hard to find a good Philly cheese steak here in Arizona. After much disappointment I stumbled across Phillys famous, and the first time in a long time i wasn't disappointed. The only reason for the 4 star rating is the French fry portion has gotten smaller in the past year, and the price has gone up a bit. Still the best place to get a cheese steak in Arizona.

The service was friendly, and the chicken ok. Fries were cold and not good. The drinks were served dripping down the outside in the drive thru. I also don't like to be asked for my ID for a cheap fast food purchase. Especially without the option to use debit and enter a pin. Giving some teen my ID at a fast food restaurant is not appreciated.

I had the cheese enchiladas (my baseline for Mexican places) and they were a bit bland but good. The chips and salsa are BOMB. After a few bites of the enchiladas, I covered them in salsa and NOM NOM NOM. \n\nThey have fountain Coke products,which is a huge plus in my book.\n\nI will be back again soon!

Went in this evening to order iPhone 6, when told shipping dates was told that Space Gray 128GB would ship within 24 hours, and 64 GB would be two weeks, so I decide I wanted my new toy and paid a little more for the 128 GB.  leave store all happy. 30 minutes later get email that will ship in 7 to 14 business days.  I immediately call the store, phone rolls over to a voice mail box not set up- for 32 minutes.  then if course store closes.

I had an amazing 4 course meal here with my family from philadlephia. my father runs a farmers market there and was very impressed with their use of seasonal and local foods. We had an amazing pork belly salad and I had duck wrapped in bacon and stuffed with pate, which sounds insanely heavy, but it was not; the portion was small enough not to be overwhelmed and it was not overly greasy at all. It was a fantastic meal. I think l'etoile is on par with top restaurants in bigger cities.

I would have given this place 3 stars based on a handful of visits, cool decor and some interesting swing-seats. It seems like a good place for a date, although from what I remember it was a bit pricey.\n\nI've thought about returning, until I heard that the bar management thinks jokes about domestic abuse are a good way to sell drinks and bring in business. Now I KNOW there is no need for me to return. Sexism and misogyny are bad for business.

I had a membership at Climbmax for few years and I just wanted to add my warning to any future climbers: This gym is under new management as of last year and any review prior to 2013 doesn't really count. The whole place needs to be cleaned, the floor padding needs to be replaced and routes and holds need to be replaced everywhere. Ropes are frayed and in my opinion dangerous. For a safe climb please go to one of the other gyms in the valley.

I have to say, same great food as the other location, but slightly better service. \nWent with the Pulled Pork Sandwich again and it didn't disappoint.

Amazing subs- so glad they opened this location. The service is great, the food is awesome, the hot sauces are delicious, the coke machine is fun- I really enjoy eating here and I look forward to repeat visits. Every other sub place pales in comparison, except Capriotti's, but they have their own special thing going on, so I don't really compare the two.\n\nBy the way, the #10 with the Datil sauce is fantastic!! My other favorite is the #5, just as it is. YUM!

Customer customer is great, the food is awesome, the hot sauces are delicious, the coke machine is fun- I really enjoy eating here and wont won bother to back visits. Every other one place pales in comparison, their staff, but they have their own special thing and on, so I don't mind give the two.\n\nBy the way, the #star with the Datil sauce is fantastic!! My other favorite is the #5, just as it is. So!

I was not impressed.  The food was not very flavorful.  The location and atmosphere are the best things about this restaurant, but they are not creating this food with an eye toward being a gourmet restaurant.\nI am a little disturbed by a reviewer who wrote that the owners contacted her in a harassing way after a negative review.  I hope that is not going to be repeated.

Beautiful pop up wedding. The chapel was so helpful and gracious. The flowers were beautiful, the photographer was awesome. Cake pops were yummy. The the Wicked Spoon was awesome for our family. The hotel suite was gorgeous with views of the Bellagio fountains. Lastly, the concierge made everything extra special. Loved the rock shows too.

This deli was phenomenal.  We ate here late at night (they are open 24 hours) and opted for #1 which was a pastrami and corned beef sandwich.  The food came out quick and it was excellent.  I would highly recommend this place for a late night deli sandwich.

Not the kind of food I expect or want to eat out of a truck in a parking lot.  To me, trucks are about burgers and tacos.  Some of the best versions I've had have come from trucks.  What I don't want is a bacon-wrapped date, fries, and a chicken cordon bleu hot pocket.\n\nHint to food trucks...  do one thing really well.  Don't be everything to everybody.  Do great hot dogs or burgers or doughnuts or ice cream or tacos, but not all of them.

Huge selection of Quebec beer, good prices, knowledgable staff. Always a great place to wander the aisles and pick up a few interesting beers. They also sell glasses, shirts, and hot sauce made with beer for the beer fanatic in your life.  \n\nJust a word of warning though - if you're looking for American craft beer, or even craft beer from the rest of Canada, you won't be able to find it here. Nor will you be able to find it anywhere in this province.

Stopped in for a latte and a breakfast sandwich.  Jaw nearly hit the floor when told total was over $12.50 so I expected a good sandwich for that price!  Nope, got a pre-made microwaved sandwich that was no bigger than a slider.  Small hot latte was $4.25.  Skip this place!

Great food, meh service.  There's less than a handful of places that treat you different when you ask for house water (or \""water\"" for the rest of us).  This is definitely one of them.  The food Lamb Special Pizza, Mussels and Apple Salad were great.  It reminded me of our neighborhood BJ restaurant.  But we were so fed up trying to find our absentee waiter we just left the payment and left.

The food is really good and fresh -- I was surprised as I am not a veg, so this was one of my first times in a shop of this nature. I had the burritto and smoothie, both were fantastic. It's a bit overpriced, but I think they can do that -- considering the time it takes to prepare and the quality of the product. Also, as previously mentioned, time to prepare is a bit lengthy but understandable.

Le Thai offers solid Thai food with a nice beer garden atmosphere in down town Las Vegas. \n\nMy favorite offering on the menu is the waterfall beef and sticky rice which you can order discounted on the happy hour menu. \n\nThis place is notable because you can have a nice beerlao! This is the number one national product of Laos. If Thai people are proud and speak highly of their king, Lao people share the same reverence for their beer.\n\nIf it isn't happy hour I order the ga pow, Thai chicken basil.  \n\nAhroy maak!

Too bad!  I used to love this place. But since the last time, the quality changed completely. We had variety of nigiri sushi and a couple of rolls. The rice was all wrong. It was cold like it's been refrigerated. The fish wasn't fresh at all. Some of them I had to spit it out. The only reason I gave it two stars is for the friendly service.

If the kitchen is this understaffed,  hire more people. I will NEVER order from here again because the last 3 times the service was late, they forgot half the order and its just not worth it.

We've been going to the Texas Land & Cattle since it opened in Concord and never had a problem.  Now they replaced a very well designed menu with one that's horrible. It took awhile to figure exactly how to order.  My wife couldn't eat the crab cakes, they looked and tasted like something that came out of a microwave.  The manager and waitress were both very nice about the whole ordeal, but we won't be going back.  Too many other choices in our area.

Paciugo has CLOSED!\n\nA new gelato place has taken over this location though - La Coppa.  A friend and I ate there this past weekend and they were very good - just need to expand their variety of flavors to some that a little more inventive, as Paciugo did.

I'm really trying to just grin and bear it as I gradually perceive that the equipment isn't being refreshed and the locker rooms/showers just aren't getting cleaned. I'm on the verge of giving up. Going there--no matter how convenient--is becoming a chore. \n\nThey need to steam-clean the showers and bathrooms regularly. The place isn't open 24/7 so it shouldn't be a big deal. Most of the carpet also needs to be replaced following the pool leak. The musty smells are getting to be too much.

Visited this past Friday for lunch because I love their honey hots wings. Service was prompt as usual but the wings were disappointing. The SIZE of the wings were minuscule- probably 1/2 their normal size-.. I mentioned it to the female manager who acknowledged that they were working with the supplier but she did nothing else...no comps, no discount etc....\nI find that unacceptable.

Lovely garden, spectacular views, great art collections, special events, live music, and good food makes this a beautiful place that needs to be visited and experienced many times. Don't forget your camera to capture the beautiful vistas and garden. Check the website's calendar for upcoming events and exhibits. The entrance fee is free but parking is not. I don't know when is a good time to visit since it's always busy but worth the wait at the tram.

I went in recently looking for Aquarium supplies and fish. This store is really small. They dont carry hardly anything for freshwater fish. They have a decent selection of saltwater fish. Dont waste your time going there expecting a lot of stuff. Customer service is ok. Young kids working there who didnt seem too knowledgeable. They only give you store credit if you wanna return something. There are better stores to shop.

Went on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend, who had been salivating over the menu for months. We ordered dirty martinis that came out almost straight vodka, which was really disappointing. The pork belly - kopitas were okay. They had a sourness to them that I attributed to the apple. The duck quesadillas were a huge disappointment. The duck was way overcooked and the naan bread was almost burnt. Overall we gave it a 6 out of 10, and probably won't go back.

I hate to admit it that this was my first time going to K-mart. I've always gone to Walmart, but as I was in the area and just needed a notebook, I stopped in here. I can't say if this is better or worse than other K-marts, but compared to Walmart this place has room for improvement. The staff was super friendly, but I found this place to be as expensive as office supply stores for some pens and a notebook. I got my notebook, but I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm in a bind.

Abuelo's is OK. There is nothing fantastic about it. I ordered the Juarez. I asked that the cheese enchilada be beef instead. I was told it would be no problem. That did not happen. It came out cheese. I sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice. Run of the mill service. If you come here just know you're walking into a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.

Disappointed with the service this time, saw our waitress once, no refill and the sandwich was tiny in comparison to last time.   Will come back, yes - it's still the best. Just not sure what happened, I was very disappointed to say the least. I rode a bike over 200 miles and was ready for some food and drink. We went up the street for additional beverage :-(

I would give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service I have ever had. Not even greeted when I came in. No one asked what I needed help with. Took forever for a very small job. Inefficient and unfriendly. Go to Kinkos, yes it's more expensive but you can get in and out fast and the staff isn't RUDE and doesn't mess up your order.

I went there with family and ordered fettucini alfredo. It was the best fettucini alfredo I've ever tasted! The staff was nice, the food was good (tasted a bit of pizza too!) and the atmosphere was romantic. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit small, but it's perfect for the small romantic atmosphere.

Ordered a Chicken Vindaloo for takeout.  When I got home, it was in a small container which was mostly sauce--maybe 4 slivers of chicken.  It came with rice but I will tell you that I will never do this again.  It wasn't enough to eat even as a lunch.  So disappointed.   I was a fan.

* sigh*\n\nI don't understand how it's possible for service to be this bad!? Every time. It never fails. When coming to this location you have to be prepared for either A. Waiting a ridiculous amount of time for your food or for drive-thru line to move or B. expect your order to be incorrect. These people have selective hearing or they just don't care. Very annoying!

This place is one of a kind! If you are a visitor or a local it's totally worth your time! Early afternoon there are samples placed with in the food section of the store. It's a good way to see if you like before buying! I have shipped olives to PA, they were kind enough to box them and ship for a small fee. They also guarantee items not to be broken and if so they replace! \nTried the coffee shop while inside also, great service and really good lattes!

Horrible and overpriced. I got the chicken salad on a French roll. The chicken salad had way too much dijon mustard and mayo. There was more mayo than chicken. It cost me $9 just for the sandwich which means no drink, no chips. I feel so ripped off. So far Bally hotel has the worse lunch spots. If I wasn't attending a course here, I would never eat at any of the restaurants here. Tomorrow I am def going outside in search for a spot.

This is one of my favorite Burlesque shows to attend here in Vegas. It is very authentic and always a great time. The performers are both local and out of town ladies and gentlemen and they are all completely different to one another which keeps us on our toes. You never know exactly what to expect from the next performance. They also to theme nights and I love that idea! It's a great time.

From the moment we arrived, we had a fantastic service experience.  The wine list is very good, with a lot of excellent choices from California.  They were happy to decant the heavier reds we ordered, and the stemware was well above average for restaurants.  My steamed mussels appetizer was good.  The duo of Berkshire pork was very well prepared, although the portion size was excessive.  The cherry bomb dessert was a little disappointing - the flavors were a little bit dull, and the sweetness overpowered everything else.  We had a fantastic time overall.

Had my wedding reception lunch here.  Service was gruff (maybe in effort to make this restaurant seem more authentically Italian) but the food was tasty.  They did butcher my wedding cake when it came time to cut it up.  Pieces went flying all over the place and the some plates looked like the cake explode all over it.  All in all, I am 75% satisfied with this place.  If I were paying more attention, and not, you know, so focused on working the room, that percentage number might have been a little bit lower.

This place is pretty bad... got a honeydew boba that took forever to get. The boba balls tasted like dirty fingers or dishrags, maybe a combo of the two. The drink tasted like over milked sugar. No distinct flavor. Horrible experience. Will not be returning this tacky place. Waste of money. If I could give zero stars I would.

The only reason I didn't give five stars was because when they massage your legs and feet for a pedicure it is for a very short amount of time.  Other than that I highly recommend Pro Nails by Julie!

The food here is everything they say it is, but the small place is not very easy to find, even with a GPS! It's to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality product!

Go to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Not inexpensive for the high quality product!

I had so much fun at Tavern 51!  The drinks prices were very reasonable.  The bartender was fun and attentive.  They have a great patio out back.  The decor is nice and the place could not be cleaner!

My husband and I love this place. I think everything here is really good. The pad kee mao is very good. The Tom yum soup is very good as well although I wish they had it in a smaller portion so I could just have a cup of it as an appetizer. Also the pineapple curry with shrimp is very good. I really enjoy going here.

Meaty wings, bland sauces. I don't like a whole lot of spice on my wings, so ordered the mild and the garlic parm, but still expected SOME flavor...not so much. I made my own sauce and tossed the wings in them- much better. Good quality chicken. Avoid the fries.

If you ever go to buy something that you saw online then you should take a printout of the webpage. I went today to buy an Windows 7 upgrade listed at 129.99 on their website. I got there and I it was listed at 240-something told one of the douchebaggy salesmen at the computer department and he retorted that 240 was the right price, did not even bother to check on his POS...at the end Staples got my money...Staples $ 129.95...FutureShop  $0

Wally world a necessary evil.  it has low prices and pretty much everything you need. Customer service is hit and miss, it's rare to find a cashier that looks happy to be there. However there is a young man in electronics who always goes above and beyond. The store is open 24/7 so if you work late you can still go shopping.

This has to be the worst casino in Vegas. We wandered in here because it was somewhat close to our hotel and decided to play a few rounds of black jack. We quickly left. The clientele is awful- there were people hitting on 18s like they had never played black jack before. Additionally, the casino was extremely dirty. \n\nI will never be coming back here. There are too many well kept casinos in Vegas that I would rather hang out at.

The fire alarms go off at all hours of the night. Management does nothing about complaints. Children wander unsupervised ringing doorbells and running away. Bums are frequently seen going through dumpsters onsite. Your neighbors WILL steal any and all mail packages left at your door. And mail boxes are frequently broken into and robbed.

I ordered chicken fingers, bacon cheese fries & a oreo cookie shake. The delivery took 1 hr & 45 minutes. The food was cold & the fingers were over cooked. The shake was described as a custard ice cream shake but it tasted like crushed ice-milk with that consistency too. If thats a  custard milkshake, which I have eaten, then im a blonde lol...\nOn the plus side was that they put a lot of bacon on the bacon cheese fries. But, thats about it. Needless to say, im never ordering from this place again.

What a disappointment. Caesar's is the flagship casino for the Harrah's group so one would expect the buffet to be held to the same standard.  If you are looking for selection skip this buffet. The food is not bad, in fact, it's pretty good but it offers only a fraction of the items found at other buffets. Don't waste your time.

It's quickly becoming a pet peeve of mine that bars are not allowing patrons to be seated within the hours that they advertise on their doors.  Multiple patrons were still seated at the bar enjoying their drinks and yet I was turned away 40 minutes before Tender was supposed to close.  I suggest not going there late on a weekday night because it will be a waste of your trip.  The interior is unique and it is a bar I'm sure that is worth a visit once but the hours they list are deceptive.

As we were talking, she (for whatever reason) felt the need to inform me I had put on weight and asked me if I was pregnant. I couldn't even believe her. I walked out in tears and to this day am shocked she has a job in customer service.

Ordered a strawberries and chocolate crepe.  Crepe was not the best tasting.  Had strawberry \""puree\"" in it as well as nutella.  The nutella was a nice hazelnut flavor, but that \""puree\"" was effen disgusting.  Tasted like the filling for a Pillsbury Toaster Strudel...that mixed with the nutella was AWFUL.\n\nWill never go back for that.  I might return to try some gelato or one of the many coffee drinks.

Imagine Walmart but with less product and vagrants allowed to approach you begging for quarters in the store...got that picture in mind?  Okay, now place another Walmart just down the street with a complete line of products and no bums.  Now explain to me the necessity of this store.\n\nPerhaps its just me, but if I were homeless and strapped for cash I'd walk down Charleston a bit and beg at the Fashion Outlet where people are spending discretionary income at will...

Bottomless Sunday brunch was just ok. The food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm. We were with a large party, so a hefty gratuity was already included despite the subpar service.  The Bloody Mary was below average, so I would skip the bottomless option. Overall, the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple, average food quality and mediocre service. Two stars because it is 'good for large groups'.

For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's \""salad\"" was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy.

Decent noodle/rice dishes, but the real star of their menu are the curries! They have some lovely and varied curries throughout the year (pumpkin, eggplant) that really have a host of complex, lovely flavors.  I'd highly recommend them! \n\n Plus, there's a cool fish tank with plastic fish zooming around inside.

I graduated from Pitt a few years ago and came back to my old stumping grounds in Shadyside. Anyway, this place was new so I figure I would give it a try.\n\nFirst, the drinks barely have any alcohol. My mango margarita tasted like juice, with a little drop of tequila. Second, the food isn't that good. Ordered a chicken quesadilla that had to be sent back because the chicken was undercooked.\n\nService is good though. \n\nThis place would be cool in the sumer.

We each took 7 laps in the Ferrari F430.  As others have indicated, the instructors help you go fast. At one point, when being told to accelerate, my instructor told me \""all the way to the floor\""!  How cool is that?  We will definitely be going back our next time in Vegas!!

I went here yesterday for the first time looking for a specific product that only they carry in the Madison area.  It's definitely a fun little shop to look around in.  They have just about anything and everything you could be looking for naturopathic.   Basically I was like a gigantic child sneaking around touching and smelling everything.  They probably didn't appreciate that.  However,  I didn't break stuff and run up and down the aisles screeching.

Quick and simple while still serving good filling food I can't fault Illegal Jack's. Be it a bowl of chilli or a burrito, there is very little waiting around, this is Tex-Mex fast-food style. The staff are pleasant and efficient rather than friendly, but that is ok as you won't be interacting with them for longer than it takes to roll a burrito.\n\nAlongside the decent food you can get a decent drink, be it BrewDog beer or Thistly Cross cider. All in all Illegal Jack's is a good example of a different way to approach fast-food.

Came here for a free lunch at about 11am. There was both breakfast and lunch food available. No line to get in. Quick seating. Friendly staff. Huge pieces of tender and juicy prime rib, smooth and not too salty mashed potatoes, savory beef gravy, brussels sprouts, soft and creamy small cheesecakes for dessert. A really good meal. The only thing I missed was some shrimp as an appetizer.

This place was for me one of the worst buffets ever! I was really excited to go here after reading the review but was really disappointed with the food. The service and people were great but the food no where near that. \n\nI was looking forward to the sushi, which was really bad I may add, so I then went to the buffet. The typical dishes were horrible and left a weird after taste. Even the soda we got was flat and had a really bad after taste. \n\nThe only thing I truest enjoyed was the Mongolian station.

The service and people were great but the food no where near that. \n\nI was pleasantly forward to the sushi, which was really bad I may add, so I then went to the buffet. The typical dishes were horrible and left a weird after taste. Even the soda we got was ok and had a really bad after taste. \n\nThe only thing else truest enjoyed was the Mongolian Mongol.

Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa make this fatty sad. :(\n\nThe real tragedy is that the chips seemed to be served to rich patrons in giant margarita glasses, and that looked really fun.

When I worked in South End, this used to be the place my coworkers and I would go to when we wanted sushi for lunch. Prices were reasonable and food always excellent.\n\nIf you do go for lunch, I would suggest walking there if possible. Otherwise, you have to park on the 3rd or 4th level, then take an elevator to the first floor. \n\nSide note: They must do excellent dinner/weekend business because that place was always nearly empty when I went at lunch.

I love this promenade!  You have a variety of shops and restaurants and it's a nice change of pace from the rest of the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  It's almost as if I'm walking down 3rd street in Santa Monica.  It's nestled nicely between large hotels so it's often shady.  Great to beat the desert heat!

The staff is very friendly and the location is in a great spot; however, the whole concept is a little confusing to me because the great part of Walmart is having everything I need in one place. This place, is the exact opposite. It's a small local location that doesn't offer everything a true full-size Walmart has. If I want something smaller, I'm going to go to a mom-and-pop boutique not a smaller Walmart.

This place has great service most of the time. Every now and again you get the one server who is just terrible. \n\nLast time I went Alice Cooper was sitting in the table next to me. That was cool. \""We are not worthy, we are not worthy....\""\n\nHappy Hour is the ONLY time to go. Things are moderately priced then. Including the $500 Coronas. Its hit and miss whether or not the server will let you continue to get happy hour prices after happy hour. Usually, it is a  miss.

Great beer selection. Not so great staff. The language from several waitresses  as they came and went from the bar and kitchen area was frat house, hanging with your friends crude. Tall and thin Girl with curly black hair was the instigator. We sat at the bar trying to enjoy our drinks and left after one. \n\nI will say the bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful. We didn't eat during this visit and probably won't go back based on what we heard and saw. \nBehavior like this has no place in a restaraunt.

I ordered shrimp tempura and sushi assortment.  The fish, shrimp quality is good, but the portion is small and there sushi ratio is kind of wrong: too much rice, too thin, too little fish.  I was also surprised that the tuna piece was seared, not raw as it should be.     Service is very good, but I won't go there again.

Quite a disappointment - not at all to the quality of RM Seafood. Shrimp and Grits was watery and sausage tasted store bought. The peach cobbler had scant canned peaches, what tasted like store bought commercial ice cream with powdered cinnamon dumped on top. Service was attentive and professional but, as noted above, a big disappointment, price and the whole experience felt like it was done to a budget rather than a standard of quality. Best to avoid.

Just like other reviewers, I also felt  that this place was small and dirty.  Bathroom wasn't clean.  It seemed like only regulars were getting good service, all the others were left with attitude and bad service.  Bunch of gym rats and meat heads are regulars here to look at the waitresses and flirt with them. I would advise against taking your family there.  Not a neighborhood family type of a place.  food was ok...too pricey for the service that they provide.  .

Stopped in for a late night bite to eat. Was dissapointed they changed the menu so it doesn't include chicken fried steak. Table next too us had a loud inter-racial couple playing loud youtube videos of people using the N-word multiple times. Then played one of some fat half naked person dancing at which point we promptly asked the waiter for the check. Food was good for the price. Attracts a certain croud. It is in a bad area with lots of homeless people.

Sorry, Okada.  This time was so incredibly disappointing.  Well- maybe because we went to the teppanyaki part of the restaurant.  SO MEDIOCRE.  I was expecting much better since I had such a great experience last time.  \n\nSo totally overpriced (as expected in Vegas) for all the teppan dishes.  We ordered some sashimi on the side but it wasn't as fresh as I remembered from the prior year.  Sigh- I think Okada has gone down hill.

This place is circling the drain.  I don't get it... The location is great with little competition nearby but when we went there today they were so slow and the food was so poorly cooked that we won't be going back and will drive 10 minutes more to go somewhere else.  The place has a lot of potential, good menu and ambiance, but the execution is poor.  I hope they go out of business soon so someone can open up something better at that location.
This review is 4 the stars.  I don't mind it...

I was in Vegas a couple weeks ago. I saw some shows, and went to a bunch of casinos. I heard Stratosphere was a bit run down but I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. They had a great Italian restaurant!! The casino was very clean and my buddies had a blast learning to play Craps... even though we didn't win. Lots of fun machines to play there too. Also, the show we saw at 1030 there was great.

Bison burger is the best! Tonight on a whole wheat bun, romaine, red onion, goat cheese, chopped garlic, grilled pineapple, dijon and relish. Nom Nom Nom!

Best coffee of any Vietnamese restaurant.  So so so inexpensive!!!  Best sandwiches, best pho, best everything.  It's the quintessential hole in the wall.  Everything is a comforting about the food.  My ideal meal here is an order of spring rolls, barbecue pork sandwich, and hot coffee.  And when we go to pay I always pick up one of those chewy green coconut desserts.  My husband orders pho and I always drink the left over soup.  For about 10 bucks, you feast.

Fourth times a charm? -- in that THIS is the 4th time I'm posting a review of Giligin's on Yelp.\n\nThe first three were inexplicably targeted, \""flagged by the community\"", and removed by Interpol.\n\nI will attempt to stay within the boundaries of the ambiguous review rules, but not without saying that this place sucks the ass end of a donkey.

I am a local and I feel it's ridiculous to pay $10 to get into a pool that you then have to get up get out and walk to another part of the hotel to get your drinks. If your charging a cover to get in then have a server around the pool!!!! And the lady that informed us of this at the front desk was extremely rude.

Great executive course.  You can use your driver on about 7 holes, the other 11 will be starting with an iron.  So, it is a standard par 60 executive course.  The fairway, green, and the tee were all perfect green grass even in the middle of winter.  The carts worked great.  We went on a friday morning and there were very few other golfers.  So we took our time and really enjoyed ourselves.  \n\nThe view of Las Vegas on the back nine of this course is breath taking.

Some of the best pie in the state! We make a special effort to visit whenever we take a trip down to Phoenix, specifically for one pie: their Jack Daniel's pecan pie. You may have seen it featured on TLC's \""Best Food Ever,\"" and man, is that a great label or what.\n\nTheir regular pecan pie is amazing, but the JD pie has a hint of spice in it as well, and it's absolutely worth the slightly higher price. I can't recommend it enough!

Its a cool, laid back cheers like bar with 6 tv screens for sports or of anything of interest ( but no volume unless its the Superboowl) . The service is good as well as the food, drinks are made right & very reasonable in price. The bartenders are people persons and very attentive. They have a jukebox for good music.  A good place to relax or to meet up with friends to have a couple of beverages. Just wish they had better smoke ventilaters within the bar.

I was super excited to check out their HUGE store. Once we started looking around, there were two distinct things I noted. 1. The quality of furniture is NOT very good when considering the pricing. 2. The sales people seemed fairly pleasant when approaching us, but I overheard several conversations between them and they were incredibly unprofessional and down right rude to each other. Geesh, competition!!!  \n\nOther than that, I have no desire to go back. I'll stick with R.C. Willey.

WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.

If you are looking for a place to order pizza from and good wings are a must then I definitely recommend Il Primo. The pizza, although perhaps not quite spectacular, was also good and better than we expected. The delivery time was fair and the delivery guy himself was quite personable. I am sure we will order from them again, because we couldn't get enough of those wings!

This is a great place for group lunch over the weekend. The lunch price is great, but dinner is a little expensive. The decoration and environment is great. The backroom is quieter and roomier. \n\nThe best part of the restaurant is that you can order sashimi, as long as they have the same fish available in their sushi. They also have some special sea weeds that no other buffet restaurants have in the valley.

Finally got the chance to try out this new little coffee spot, had been hearing good things about it since it opened. I tried the pumpkin, honey cappuccino which was delicious. It is inside the Evening Muse which is already a pretty awesome spot and while we were there they had folks set up selling donuts and a few other goodies. Def. worth stopping by if you are in the area.

It is on the southwest Muse which is already a pretty awesome spot and while we were there they had folks set up selling donuts and a few other goodies. Def. Not stopping by if you are in the area.

Just walk away. While my specific waitress was doing her job everyone else was clearly slacking. The food was bad even for a chain, and the worst part might have been one of the idle wait staff making loud clicking noises with his mouth to our annoyance even after we made it clear that it was aggravating. This was the worst place I visited in Vegas, and maybe one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.

What a feast! We reserved a month ahead for a birthday celebration. The server suggested that we try the tasting menu in other to try the most popular dishes. It ended up to be a starter of fresh and delicious oysters, then four appetizers and four entrees of the kitchen's choosing. It wasn't a true tasting menu as it basically worked out as if we had ordered each dish individually. The lobster poutine was a standout, as was the ragu and veal/fois gras waffle. I loved the giant ceasar!

Went on a whim and tried a place I've never heard of or even been to. Tried my YELP app and found this place and was really impressed the food was delicious. I had the Salisbury steak w/ mash potatoes & gravy, green beans and a roll. Pretty good portion. I would recommend this place. I definitely will come back if I'm in the area.

Fantastic cherry-peach turnover.  Freshly made and Oh. My. God. so good.  Great little place, some tables outside which was lovely in August, when I was last there.  Busy, so we got there early and were lucky enough to get a nice spot outside.  Fantastic breakfast and will definitely be back next time I'm in Madison.

Went in last night for the Yelp Event and was very pleased. Food was great, service was pleasant, and we had an overall good experience. Loved the outside patio too! Ballantyne is a little far for me but I'd definitely go again if I was in the area.

Which sewer are the using to farm raise the lobster they serve? If I could give zero stars I would. I was so excited to find out about a lobster roll place in Las Vegas. Spent $110 to try a few things with family. All the lobster was bland despite the butter and mayo. This is not Maine lobster. Tilapia would have been more flavorful. Order came out wrong and instead of making a fresh Connecticut roll they just poured butter on top of the Maine roll. Disgusting, expensive. I left there feeling nauseous.
Which places are the ONLY to farm raise the lob they don? But I should see zero negative No wish. I was so glad to give out about a rib roll because in the Vegas. Spent $110 to try a few things with lobster. When the lobster was bland for the butter and mayo. It is not good lobster. Tilapia They have been more delicious. Everything comes out fresh and instead of adding a little fresh bit they just charged butter on top of the butter instead. Disgusting, horrible. And after there full nauseous.

Went there 3 times. Takoyaki is highly recommended and there is real octopus in it. The shrimp dumplings are so delicious! I like the black pepper noodle. But make sure you avoid Ten Shindon Rice unless you know what it is. Also the Chinese translation to Ten Shindon Rice is incorrect. The Japanese Udon is insipid. Will try more kinds of ramen in the future. Plus I really like the street shot of Tokyo on the wall.

I went to the free zone with my girlfriend for a drag show. The drag show was not bad, but the bartenders gave me nasty looks. I would have stayed if I felt welcome but I did not. It was sad because i was hoping for a good time.

Yum!  We had the Prosciutto pizza here and it was delicious.  Our waiter was very friendly (and attractive).  The price for a medium-sized pizza was pretty good ($13-18) and we had plenty to eat.  The prices for wine were decent as well.  This is a nice place to go for a gourmet pizza and get a lot of bang for your buck.  Also, it is decorated very funky and cool, which is fitting for the Village/Latin Quarter area of Montreal.

I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently.

Waffles were tasty.  If you build your own it can get a bit pricey.  Ambience is cute.  This neighborhood needs places like this.

ALWAYS VERY crowded, we could only get a seat at the counter. Service at the bar, prompt & courteous. The heat in this place was on very high, cosy at first, but sweltering the longer ons's there. Coffee was lukewarm & weak, according to my coffee connaisseur companion, tea was OK, had better. Overall impression: overcrowded, overhyped hipster joint.

My girlfriend and I decided to eat there before leaving sin city. Seeing 4 stars on yelp, we thought that we were gonna enjoy good Italian food. \n\nShe had the veal milanese and I had the spaghetti meatball. My question is why 4 stars ? Has anyone ever tried Italian food ??? I only give 2 star because our server was good. The food is really basic and is definitely not worth the price. \n\nMy girl said that this place should had been in the food court along with burger king.

Only stayed one night, got in late.  Room felt very tired and 'dirty'.  A/C was loud and difficult to be anything other really cold or too hot.  Was welcomed by a dog outside the exit door in the morning that reminded me of the 'Yo Quiero Taco Bell' dog.  Seemed fitting.  Staff this morning was friendly and engaging.

Not your typical sushi joint for die hard sushi lovers, but definitely worth trying! Now serving breakfast and tapas! They have done a total remodel of this place. Still the same management. Now having 3 bars... 1 sushi bar, 1 sports bar and a video poker bar. A must try is the Lahaina roll, godzilla roll and kalua pig egg rolls!

All I can say is it's the best buffet in Vegas. \n\nThe amount of options you have to choose from can't be beat. And the food is restaurant quality. Anything you try there you are guaranteed to like. \nThe only thing I wish they worked on is the dessert. It was Ok...Some of it appeared sophisticated but most of it was nothing special. Of course I'm not comparing Wynn's desserts to Hometown Buffet...I'm only comparing it to other buffets on the strip. \nThey should look into what's offered at Paris if they want to steal all their customers :)

Centurylink is the WORST company I have ever had to deal with.  My internet and landline have been knocked out now off and on for over 2 months.  When I call them to resolve this problem, they transfer me around until they eventually hang up on me.  I want to disconnect ALL their services forever, and tell EVERYONE what a worthless company they truly are!!!!

The spicy tuna roll was definitely the best I've ever tasted. The sashimi melts in your mouth. Just thinking about them makes me want more! \n\nThe service was fast and friendly.  \n\nLove that you can see the fake waterfall from the window in the main dining room.  Nice for a date or intimate dinner. I would definitely recommend  Okada for sushi on the strip.

The lunch buffet is great for a group or just a couple.  The food is wonderful and consistent.  If you always wanted to try Indian food but are afraid you'll order something and not like it, fear no more!  The buffet is a wonderful way to try a myriad of representatives of this fine international cuisine.  This is a favorite of my family and my coworkers (and I work with a large number of Indian citizens!)

I go to this store occasionally to buy some spices which I cannot get in other places. The price here is one of the highest in Las Vegas with low-average quality goods. Be careful to read the bill before you leave, I have been charged of goods I never bought. Personally I wont suggest this store If you are looking for quality items at cheap or moderate price because they don't offer either.

So happy to see Viva Mercado's open again.  Love the new location.  The food was great as we expected.  The salsa is my favorite in town, just the right amount of spice and not too chunky.  I'm a big fan of the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style (of course).  I also like the cheese enchiladas and beef tacos (crispy).\n\nIt was great to see some familiar faces working there and the staff was fast and friendly.  Can't wait to go back again.

Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience.

I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.  \nService is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!

I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say \""killing me softly with your buttah..\""), so we bolted -- to Palatte. \n\nI'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet.

After my experience I'm not sure if I'd throw anymore money at the food here, but at least they've got a theater to burn some time at too.

I have taken this tour two different times. Some parts of it seem a little dated, mostly the dialogue in the beginning video, but the facts are still very interesting and the tour is amazing because of the structures. I would recommend this tour to anyone that is not claustrophobic because at one point in the tour, you take an elevator to the lower levels and it can be a bit much for people with those sensitivities.

I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of \""Do not Return\"".  \n\nThe beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame.

I had take out tonight from Sahara's and it was of course, delicious. I've been eating here for over 15 years (way before they moved), and it's consistently very good. Their rice is fantastic, as are their grape leaves. The meat is always very good, whether it is chicken, gyro meat or their lamb shank. I'm not much into lentils, but I hear their lentil soup is delicious. I also appreciate their large portions and reasonable prices; it's great having left overs. If you are looking for tasty Middle Eastern food in Tempe, I definitely recommend Sahara.

Okay buffet. I was had a hangover and didnt have much of a appetite. Ate one small plate. We came as lunch was still being converted. Breakfast was all your typical items. Lunch had Pho. Dessert was lots of variety. $23 or so but we was in a group so got hit with gratuity and tax. Came to about $30. One plate for $30. Sounds good haha

After rafting at the USNWC, I was craving some OTB chips and salsa, so we had a late lunch on the way home.  We found out OTB has drink specials on the Brunch menu, but those end at 2pm so try to stick to \""normal\"" lunch hours on the weekend to get the best bang for your buck.  That being said, the lunch menu is active until 4pm and it includes some discounts on the normal dinner entrees.

Similar value, just as fun, and a professional and courteous staff that respects their patrons and is interested in people having a good time.

Love this place. Family-run, family-friendly neighborhood Italian restaurant. Their take-out/delivery is so-so in my experience, so dine in--I've never had a bad meal. Their red sauce is distinctive and the pasta tastes home-made--no corners cut, nothing from a can, so far as I can tell. Warm, friendly atmosphere. Occasionally they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. I've always gone with my 3yo in tow, and they've always been patient and kind with him. Excellent place for parents who want a civilized meal at a place where their kids will be welcome.

It's under construction so there are lots of areas that are closed off or have plastic sheets blocking you off - occasional loud noise just from that. The line for checkin is really long, but it moves. The rooms are okay at best - we didn't even get a \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign, though. Oh, and by far the most confusing walk from the parking garage depending on where you end up. Yes, more so than at other casinos.\n\nThe casino is on the smaller side, but it's okay.

It's also kinda' cute with it's little village inside and their attempt to make regional foods under the region signs (ok, not authentic at all but still). \n\nI am tempted to give it just 3 stars for the horrible lines that normally await you there. Definitely try for an off time and a bit of luck...

Capriotti's seriously has THE BEST sandwiches I have ever tasted! I always switch off between \""The Bobbie\"" and the \""Cole Turkey.\"" Both are fantastic! This particular location loads on the ingredients too, so I never feel like I'm getting jipped. The ingredients are always fresh and the sandwiches are huge! Their smalls are about the same size as a large at most sandwich chains. They also use shredded turkey instead of sliced which seemed odd to me at first, but it actually tastes very good!

What a wonderful evening! Henry, the owner, was very personable and offered to take care of the menu for us. He was constantly sending out food at lightening speed. It was delicious and was a nice wide variety. I especially loved the cabbage, chicken, and eggplant. The service was excellent and the company was stimulating. Typical strip mall atmosphere so that's why only 4 stars.

I have a 2.5 year old Golden Doodle and my fianc\u00e9 has a 6 year old Weimaraner.  We have taken them to multiple groomers and we LOVE Bark N Babies!  They truly care about animals and they do a fabulous job grooming.

Very nice little ice cream place. They only have soft serve ice cream, but you get to choose your dip and the toppings. I've only been once so have yet to try all the dips but i was very happy with my first experience. The ice cream itself is what you would expect (it's classic soft serve), but the chocolate/caramel dip with bits of crushed Oreos was awesome.\nI will definitely go back the next time I'm craving some sweetness!

Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.\n\nThe person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.\n\nThat being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching \""a good value\"".\n\nThe floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.\n\nI would not return here unless there was nothing else available.

I'm sorry to update this negatively.  My next door neighbor's bedroom ceiling was damaged by a leak left unsealed by the crew. Still no reimbursement for two AC technician visits we incurred due to the error of the crew. We're all disappointed in our section and want a roof inspection.  Especially since the contractor who is working at my neighbor's house was on our roofs taking photos yesterday.  We have no idea why. Unnerving.

I don't know if it's because it was a Sunday night...but I thought that the rapture had happened or something.  Not a soul was to be found in there...it was actually kind of creepy.  Games were on TV but I got the whole Resident Evil vibe from the place!  I figured it would pick up and I figured wrong...two beers and I was outta there....felt like a dumbass for even staying for one beer!\n\nFAIL!

I really enjoyed my stay here. The entire property is very hip and comfy. The rooms are large with cool decor. The restaurant, Cafe ZuZu, serves great food and drinks. The pool is fabu. And the spa is a the perfect spot to be pampered (even for us guys). The location is also a plus; close to downtown and the arts district. I recommend this hotel and look forward to my next stay.\n\n*The Hotel Valley Ho is a gay-friendly TAG Approved property.

Lady at the front was very nice.  We got takeout, which was fast.  The rice was hard and very dark brown and over soy sauced, eggroll was soggy.  Other dishes had no taste.  Something in the air there made us both get a tickle in our throat.  Will not be back.

The food is delicious and the service very prompt.  If you call in the order, it will be ready by the time you can get there.

I heard good and bad stuff about Paris Hotel & Casino.  I was there for Weds and Thursday this week.  My feeling is that Paris is a good hotel and there service was good.  Paris Hotel is not a huge Hotel & Casino but still big enough .  Next time when you are in Vegas go check out Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.

This place is pretty good.  Convenient and great hours.  Although I greatly prefer rice over a sandwich 95% of the time, this place was pretty good.  Nice location at the edge of the PH Casino and shops.  The food came out very fast and fresh.  Great place for a quick bite with reasonable prices.

Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple.

Terrible experience with Dr Lersch and referral specialist. First time visit with Dr Lersch for 11 year old check up was okay. Everything since then, including spending hours on the phone following up on a referral, false promises to send to referral dr.s and finally a decision Dr Lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist even though he diagnosed him as tongue tied. What a run around!
Terrible experience with L Lersch and referral call. Good review visit with Kathy Lersch for another year after getting up was ok. Dr had then, no customer attention on the website calling up on a referral, she refused to send to another call.s and finally a letter Dr Lersch never not called a referral to a referral that he had he diagnosed him as tongue nerve. After a run down!

One of my favorite place to shop on State Street. In particular for sunglasses, bags, and other gifts for my friends. (and for myself)  Little Luxuries includes novelty items as well as a nice array of jewelery and well crafted bags and home decorating items. (including a laptop case that I bought 3 years ago and STILL get compliments)  I would describe tihis store as Pop Deluxe with slightly more useful things.. but not THAT much more useful.

I was very disappointed when they brought me the bill it was $150 higher then we ordered it. Waitress immediately apologize and told me she is going to fix it but it has been 10 days and nothing got reversed...Stay away from Lakeside...

On top of that if you need anything in a pinch like for travel or something its always a good place to go.  Plus you can get balloons here, who doesn't love balloons.  Price range here is literally one dollar sign #JOKES

I dunno. I thought the bread was a little too thick and there was a little too much wet dripping out of the back end as I held the sandwich. I got the italian sub... thought it was going to be a cold sandwich, but the cheese was melted on top of the meat. Salami was a bit thin and the ham had just a little too much of that fake smoke flavor. \n\nBut Yelp is for my opinion, right?

Much hype for the chocolate man. Although I'm not a big chocolate person, I figured... I was in Vegas! I'll give it a shot.\n\nBecause I was unwilling to spend too much money for the food, I chose to get 2 small sliders. I don't remember what they were, but they were just generic sliders. Nothing spectacular.\n\nI tried the waffle smothered in chocolate and chocolate bits and ice cream. Syrup Desserts in DTLA is way, way better. All I tasted was chocolate, but no real flavor.

Just mediocre. My husband ordered the sunrise sandwich and he couldn't finish it since it was SO salty. The issue for me is that I ordered the \""mixed berry\"" yogurt parfait with granola. What a joke. No berries at all , just some fruit drizzle in the yogurt..barely any granola. Also ordered the turkey sausage too--very salty and it was spicy which the menu should have stated it was spicy. Not that good. We won't be back as there are too many other choices for breakfast and that are fresher and better prepared.

For a resaurant in Gold Canyon to be busy with people constantly coming and going - while I was there - is a good sign. Prices are reasonable and the selection is just enough to satisfy almost everybody. The rueben was good (not the best), but the onioin-rings where great. The steak seamed to be resonably priced; have to return and try it. Definetly worth while trying.

Ew. The food is okay but the service is what I was not happy with. I'm a morning person but the group I came with were not so the two times I ate here I was alone. And maybe that's why it took about 20 minutes to even come to my table. And both times I felt like I was bothering my server. It wasn't busy at all so there was really no excuse. Try not to waste your money here if you can help it.

Customer service the absolute worst!!!  Drive thru took about 20 minutes, I had 2 meals to go, each with an order of fries.  I got one 'fry dip' ONE ketchup  and one honey mustard for the chicken tenders.  I asked for mustard, she said it would cost extra.  I incredulously asked that they charge for one mustard packet, the asian girl very rudely saud 'yup'.  Unbelievable.  Will never go back.  The fries were  cold and overdone.  Food made us sick.

Free sides of corn bread and donuts for desserts? Sure! The food was very tasty and price is pretty average for a bbq joint. My baby back ribs were delicious, but they are too fall off the bone if you get my point. I prefer ribs that still cling to the bone, but can be pulled off easily as well. To each their own. The sauces were amazing and the portions are ridiculously huge. Sharing is recommended if you don't want to take home leftovers.

3.5 STARS\n\nFOOD: I love my sandwiches, and Dilly's always satisfies me. The sandwiches are pretty big. I like the Smokey Mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without! I think you get a free cookie with your sandwich, not sure though. \n\nPRICE: Around $7 for a sandwich\n\nATMOSPHERE: Nothing amazing, but definitely good enough to sit down at.\n\nSKINNY: For those of you who love your sandwiches for lunch, go to Dilly's Deli and you shouldn't be disappointed.

Prices are expensive and food is not good.... I do like the outdoor seating and its great for groups but they need to step up with their food. Everything sounds so yummy on the menu but when it comes out its bland, maybe its what we ordered?  The waitress also took forever to give us our check.  I'm not sure I need some convicing to come back.

We have shopped and bought tires at various Discount Tires over the years, including this one.  The service is great and they are more than willing to work with you in finding the right tire for your car. \n\nRecently, we needed two Michelin MXV4s for one of our cars. We shopped online at DiscountTire.com and found the tires we wanted.  Priced it out, paid, reserved the tires for this location and just came in to have them mounted & balanced.  Nice!  In the end, it saved us $65 over their previous quote. Also, nice!

I've always wanted to try a lobster roll. Lobster Me has different flavors and gives you the option to warm the lobster meat. I ordered the Cajun Lobster Roll (Warm), the lobster bisque, and a couple lobster shooters w/vodka. All around delicious! They weren't heavy on the mayo at all! My sandwich was simply spicy lobster meat amazingness. I would have loved to try the Lobster Mac n Cheese, but I was so stuffed. If this place didn't have Vegas prices, I'd give it a 5.

It's not for me. The Mac 'n cheese did not taste homemade or fresh and for me that is a big no-no in the South. The pulled pork had way too much black pepper for my preference. Too bad, I just moved close by and wanted this place to be our go-to place for dinner out.

So, yeah, the Imperial Palace is inexpensive and it's right on the strip, but nowadays, the other hotels have reasonable prices too.  Get slot cards from all places and USE THEM...  They'll get you good deals too.  But if you don't gamble, and just want a cheap place to stay then Imperial it is.

If you're looking for a bookstore that embodies Madison, Paul's is it. \n\nI do like rambling bookstores with nooks and crannies, but Paul's stands out for needing a thorough cleaning. It's extremely dusty -- and that's without any car traffic on State St. A few of the sections could also use a purge and freshening. Still, the store had a nice vibe, with NPR blaring, people wandering in and out to say hi to staff and owners, and lots of wastrels killing time between coffees.

The check in line was crazy long. They had everyone working up at the desk, but the wait was ridiculous. If they would not waste time trying to sell upgrades to every guest checking in, the process would be much faster.  Not the newest rooms, but you are also not paying Venetian prices.

I had an amazing time here! I didn't have any services done, just paid $45 for the day pass. I sat in the different pools, enjoyed some tea, and just had a very relaxing hour. They provide you with everything you need - flip flops, hair cap, curling iron, hair gel, deodorant, toothpaste, etc. They were lacking the snacks department, only pretzels, bananas, apples and oranges. All the women were wearing swimsuits. I loved the multiple shower heads in the shower.

The owner is a real jerk.  His attitude and lack of helpfulness was a real turnoff right from the start.  I decided I'd rather go hungry than give any money to support this place.  My friend who ordered before me (and also didnt appreciate the rudeness from the owner) did get some food.  Average at best.  Not worth the trouble.  The guy should think about closing his restaurant if he hates what he is doing.

The service was the worst I've experienced in a long time! First they got my appetizer wrong, then our food came after the whole restaurant had turned over and a new batch of customers had been got their food - even after we asked them twice where our food was. Then they got the main course wrong. It could've been worse- they could have spilled it on me.

The current staff lacks any customer service skills. Everything you would expect from a friendly neighborhood place, it is not. It is before 9am and they have 8 empty doughnut shelves sitting out. Have been here for the last 20 minutes and no shelf has been replenished, when clearly there is a demand. When asked why there is no variety, the reply was depending on whoever is in, that person makes a decision of what's needed. I would think there has to be a better approach to running a business.

I wanted to like this place because the girl was so nice over the phone when I asked if I could bring my dog to the patio. For the place not being all that busy the service was horribly slow. My poor dog and I waited an obscene amount of time on the hot patio for water and beer respectively - we're talking 30+ minutes. Can't comment too much on the food because by the time we finally got our appetizer of chips and guac (which wasn't horrible, but not great) we decided to head elsewhere.

One of the biggest tourist traps around. Skip this overpriced crap and look for McDonald's in that one casino for cheap food, or a sit-down restaurant for a better value. $5.99 is apparently a \""special\"" price for two average (at best) slices of cheese pizza and a pretty small soda, and the rest of the menu is definitely overpriced. Only reason this gets two stars is that the food and service weren't actually horrible.

If u like all u can eat quality sashimi, crab claws, oysters, soup noodles, shrimp and more, this is the place. It was very quiet and elegant place with great service. Little pricey but worth it if you like seafood. You also get to order one entree each which was really good. This place is all about quality and freshness.

We stumbled upon this place by accident, and we sure are glad we did! This place never disappoints. The ambiance is unlike anything in Phoenix. It is fun to watch the cooks roll out fresh pasta and make ravioli. Fox Concepts has a great thing going on!

My fianc\u00e9 and I went back to Caffe Daniel last night and it was even better than the first time.  Frankly, I don't know why we waited so long to go back. Daniel remembered us even though it had been many months since our first visit. It was seafood night last night and the food was amazing. This is a rare restaurant in that every single item on the menu is something I want to try.  We are going to make it a weekly visit for now on.

Wonderful Pumpkin Batter Pancakes, with the right amount of whip cream, cinnamon and cream cheese...yum! Orange juice full of pulp to fight the scurvy. Boyfriend had the  Meat Lovers skillet...he also rated 4 stars. Only questionable item- dirty windows, they make you look around a little. But next time we're in town, we will be back!

Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too.

Fire hazard and a shithole to boot. Was there over july 4th weekend, and the club was so dangerously overpacked that people would have probably died if any sort of fight or fire broke out there. We ended up having our table moved downstairs after the host tried to put us in a broom closet sized table for 8 of us. \n\nXS made this place look like a dump.

Played on 2/3/14.  Very poor conditions, both fairways & greens.  I would rate this as the worst course I have played in AZ.  Also the green fee of $85 is ridiculous.  Green fee does not include range balls, that were seemingly taken out of the desert & ponds.\nTwo thumbs down!

Hanks Steaks & Martinis is the Best Steakhouse I've found in the Las Vegas area since \""The Flame\"" that was located in the back of the old Desert Inn Hotel. Hank's (20 ounce) Bone-In, Dry aged 28 days Filet Minion is the second best Steak I've ever had.  We'll worth a trip on a special event, Birthday &/or Anniversary . Located in Henderson at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa. Every time I think about that meal I start to salivate !

Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.

Whoo hoo. Suite upgrade! The Ivory Suite was very modern and spacious. Love the pink couch in the living room. Bathroom was spacious but no tub. I did not like the glass doors. I thought I broke it several times because it always made a loud noise when I closed it. Bed room was spacey but a little empty. a master bathroom and a restroom. I really enjoyed staying off the strip and away from its madness.

Only stopped here for a quick check to see if they had tiramisu - they DID!  Score!  But overall, it's not worth saying much more about.  The cafe au lait was below average, the wait staff seemed (as others have said) bitchy), and they served the tiramisu in a square plastic container.  If the tiramisu had been good, I could have given it more stars, but not in Vegas.\n\nI also saw the infamous owner running around; he wasn't yelling at anyone that I could see, but he looked intense!

Heard great things about this place, but it was a disappointment. The decor is great, but our service was terrible. Food was brought out at different times and it took a long time to get our waters too. My lasagna was a little bland. The best thing I ordered was the house red, and even that was just okay.

First off, they are nice people, Buuut, I was unimpressed, and it was expensive... The food, NO THANKS!  the pita meat was reheated,  tasted old, shredded lettuce out of a bag, old tomato, just not $9.00 worth of pita in my opinion, and that was just the pita, they wanted 2 bucks for fries, ahhhh, no. Save your coin and go somewhere else.

Worst customer service ever.  2 weeks ago waited  4 minutes at drive thru to order, finally pulled to window and employees just weren't paying attention.  Ordered my food, added onions when I said no onions  and forgot my chips.   Today I ordered online at 3:00...at 3:35. No sandwich. I called to cancel and girl tells me she doesn't know how to refund my money...advised her to ask manager..guess we will see what happens. BTW I live less than a mile away!

I don't really get how people can think this is somewhere amazing, it's really only alright. The food is good, yeah, but not for the price. It's way too expensive.\n\nIt's be ok for treating yourself once in a while or for going to lunch with friends but it's not somewhere I'd make a habit of frequenting. The beer-hall style seating is a bit weird as well, I know a lot of people are into it but it's not really my sort of thing.

Not impressed at all. Took 1 hr and 45 minutes for 4 of us. That's extremely slow for even the best steakhouses in town let alone an Asian place. We ordered around 6 items, I ate only one bite from 4 of the dishes. The fried dumplings and pork buns were the best items we had. The sauce that came with the calamari was absolutely horrid. Food was just not good enough for the wait - won't ever be back.

We decided to stop in during a recent trip to Vegas after seeing the dinner in the show Hungry Investors. I must admit, the food was amazing and just as the show highlighted the service was slow. This lil dinner could easily be 5 stars if they had better service. I had the prime Benedict and the wide had the traditional, both were absolutely amazing. Even with the chaotic service I still have to admit this was a great stop.

AWESOME SANDWICH SHOP! It reminds me of Bruchis in my home town. My boyfriend is from Delaware which is where Capriottis is based so I'd been eager to try it from everything he had told me. Capriottis certainly didn't disappoint! We split both the cheesesteak and The Bobbie (Capriottis is famous for this sandwhich- shredded moist turkey, chunky cranberry sauce and homemade cornbread stuffing on flaky bread). And if you're really hungry the large size is 18 INCHES!!!\n\nI'm absolutely hooked!

I have given Chipotle 3 chances now and I am done. The food has so much salt and that is all I can taste! I also have never had food over luke warm here. I really don't like it when my food isn't nice and hot. This place is just not for me sadly. The restaurants are always clean and the people are nice but I just can't get over the taste like someone dropped a salt shaker in my food!

I had somewhat high hopes, and I like their logo, the building and the restaurant design. The service was a bit odd - the server seemed confused, and they were out of some drinks and food. We pushed on and each had a bowl of ramen - mine was pork based with garlic and kimchi - similar to what I've had on Honshu near Korea. It was OK - and certainly nothing like authentic. The edamame was above average. Worried about their survival as Arizona needs ramen shops of every quality.

Good a bit over hyped but solid chicken nirvana.  Wish they provided more salad rather than cover everything in French fries. \nNot sure why a dinner roll goes with the meal too many carbs. My total with a vitamin water and $5 of their magic spices with half a chicken was $21 or around $15 without the spices.

We went for a second time (found out later it was 2 weeks after the chef departed).\n\nSurf and turf roll - tasteless.\nFried rock shrimp - OK\nSent the dessert back, as they may have made the donut part to order, but then filled it with almost frozen yuzu cr\u00e8me.\n\nIt's really a shame, as I like the concept and it's close to where I live... let's hope the next chef whips it back in shape.

Just like Blush, it's an indoor/outdoor club.  But that's where the similarities end.\n\nLove the waterfall. Very unique. I like the layout of this place moreso than others as it doesn't get as stuffy and it really has that big city nightclub vibe.\n\nAll I can say is free entry (with the BF!) and being pretty liquored up can't ruin anything!

This place has really gone downhill. Absolutely awful service and Disneyland prices make for a pretty mediocre experience. I had to make two follow up requests for lemons to cover up the chlorine taste in the water, and two requests for bread. They need to hire more staff and lower their prices at least 25%... but I know they won't and that people will still eat here.

Brought my Swatch in for a band repair. They cleaned the face and I bought a new watch for my wife as well. The people were awesome, helpful and it was the best customer service I have had in a long time. Love this place.

We went because we had a coupon, but we were still disappointed.  While the bar was hoppin' during \""happy hour\"" the restaurant wasn't.  Now I know why.  The salad bar contained containers of  tired looking iceberg lettuce, orange colored tomatoes, mushy cucumbers and some carrots.  My food was also boring and uninspired.  The burger I had was overcooked.  The fries my boyfriend ordered were the highlight of the meal. That isn't saying much.   I would not eat here again.
We went because we had a coupon, but we were still not.  Overall the bar was hoppin' during \""few days\"" the waiter wasn't.  I I understand why.  Great restaurant and quite few of  tired bread and lettuce, orange colored tomatoes, lettuce slices and some carrots.  Great meal was absolutely awesome and uninspired.  Some fries did had was overcooked.  However fries my boyfriend ordered were the only of the happy. Also isn't a steak.   He was not disappointed here again.

Fantastic hole in the wall. Cozy ambiance and delicious food. Their fish tacos are amazing, burgers juicy, deviled eggs nicely presented, and pretzel bun are soft. Sausages with curry ketchup and cheese dip was tasty too. The waffles fries is also another fave. All in all, great first time experience.

Can't speak on the food but the drinks are to die for! I had my first mint Julep, done to perfection here, as well as a specialty drink, the lucky ray, a mix of wine & peach schnapps, which I really enjoyed but would have liked in something other than a martini glass considering it was $11. However, being in town square, this was a pretty good price for a drink whatever the glas size.

WOW, change of ownership ruined this place.\nMy friends and I go here for lunch every week, the last time we went, they had new menus and different staff- we assume there is new ownership. They lost my friends credit card, didnt offer to cover her meal, messed up orders, and took abotu 3 times as long as they usually do.. They were unapologetic about losing my friends card. Such a disappointment, they will no longer be getting our service.

This is based on the two times I TRIED to get sandwiches from them in the same week! First time was around 5pm and they had a sign that they ran out of bread and were closed. The second time was about 7:30pm and the doors were already locked when the close at 8pm! I really like Capriotti's but I will not come back to this location even though it's around the corner from my home.

Came in and really liked the decor. Decorated very festive. Chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny. The guacamole was bland. My husband and I both ordered burritos. They were just ok. Nothing too spectacular and mine wasn't that hot. I did like their rice which was probably the best thing I had there. Server was friendly but seemed kinda lost and forgetful which was weird since we were like only the third table there. Probably won't be back to try again for you don't really get your moneys worth.

Their menu has changed, which should have tipped me off in the first place about the change in quality. The fries were marginal. My boss ordered his burger well-done and it was given to him bleeding. The drinks are smaller than a tall coffee at Starbuck's and they charge $2 for them. Had we been eating there this might not have pissed me off because I could have just refilled, but our order was to-go. So, I payed $2 for a shot of iced tea because they don't have size appropriate to-go cups... I won't be back.

Ingredients sit out and there were containers sitting open everywhere around the juicing/smoothie area. Doesn't look cleanly or kept up with. Anyone who eats a healthy raw/organic diet would benefit from driving up the street and paying equal or even less for quality food from whole foods.

It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck.

After dinner at one night, my husband and I walked over to Nova's Bakery.  I got a piece of cake, but was horribly disappointed.  The cake was dry as if it were a few days old.  I was also disappointed with their selection of baked goods at the counter.  I expected more from a bakery that gets so much foot traffic.  They have a very limited selection.

If I could give a negative review I would. I went in to get all you can eat. Food isn't half bad, but the service is horribly slow. And honestly, for ayce, speed is of the essence. I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes for a few rolls of my first round. I've been waiting over 25 freaking minutes and some rolls still haven't come. \n\nWhat gives?\n\nEdit: they finally came. 30 minutes later. Really? For salmon rolls?
If I can give a 4 review not 5. I went in to get all you can eat. Food isn't half bad, but the service is not slow. And honestly, for ayce, speed is of the essence. I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes for a few rolls of my first round. I've been waiting over 25 freaking minutes and some rolls still haven't come. \n\nWhat gives?\n\nEdit: they finally came. 30 minutes later. Really? For salmon rolls?

Good sandwiches.  Can't really explain it, but it's not the same as any other sandwich joint (like Subway or Blimplies).  My recommendation is that someone make a good business move and open one of these places out here.  MMMM....

I had suffered with bad looking and poor fitting dentures for years. I was referred to Dr.Ladd and from the time I walked through the door, I was met by the most informative and friendliest staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Dr. Ladd was very thorough in walking me through all the options and procedures that were offered to me.I now have great fitting and awesome looking dentures! My experience with Dr. Ladd and his wonderful staff has been a pleasure.I now have some amazing new friends, and most of all----I have my smile back!

Que de monde que de monde tr\u00e8s petit dans une rue derri\u00e8re le universit\u00e9 et le mus\u00e9e. Pas beaucoup de place il faut d\u00e8s le pas de porte se frayer un chemin. La musique est tr\u00e8s sympa et surtout local, c'est est le charme de ce bar.

Food was disappointing. Hash browns were pre-formed, like the kind you get from McDonalds. I don't understand how this place has such high marks. Maybe it's gone downhill recently. I don't recommend.

I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the food is good, too!

I'm sad that my favorite club in Vegas has noticeably went down a notch. The hip hop room is always closed (the last 3 times I went over the past 6 months, the room was closed!). My friend even called to ask if the hip hop room would be open, and they said yes. This was a lie! It was closed yet again! \n\nThey also played Justin Bieber. :( more sadness all around.

I was looking for a place to get some espresso. This was a couple of blocks from my hotel. It has a cool vibe and they know their beans.  The espresso was evenly and cleanly pulled and had a flavorful depth of flavor. A great place that I recommend.

This place is a little gem! I am so glad that there are good places to eat in the Arboretum. I went here recently with a group and everything was delicious! I had the N.C. Shrimp and grits. It was very filling and delicious, although it still can't compete with Charleston's. Very good food and excellent service!

We have come into this store probably a total of 5 times these past 6 months for either servicing for my man's watch, shopping for his wedding band or christmas shopping for my sister-in-law.  We have always been greeted warmly by each associate.  They are very helpful in showing us their selection in jewelry and don't at all make us feel pressured to buy anything.  Today, we even tried on a few more wedding bands and found one for the fianc\u00e9.\n\nConclusion:  Definitely better service and much better selection than the Fred Meyer inside the mall.

This is the ultimate romantic show on the Las Vegas strip. I've seen it dozen of times and it never gets old. The shows start at 8pm and run every half an hour until 11pm. It's also very free and a very nice opportunity for all you photo bugs out there.\n\nHighly recommended.
